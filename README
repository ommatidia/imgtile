This is a very lightweight application meant to break down large images into tile sections parameterized by an exponential zoom, and the corresponding x and y coordinates.

Dependencies:
build-essentials
imagemagik
others... todo

Usage:
./imgtile {srcimg} {output_directory=./}

TODO:
parameterize zoom levels, calculate optimal tile size such that deepest zoom level requires no pixel level changes from the original image.
